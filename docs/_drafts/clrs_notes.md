How to prove the correctness of an algorithm?
* A loop-invariant proof is a form of mathematical induction, where to prove that a property holds, you prove a base case and an inductive step.

How to analyze the performance of an algorithm? What model it's based on?

Most of this book assumes a generic one-processor, random-access machine (RAM) model of computation:
* sequential instructions execution, no concurrent operations
* each instruction or data access takes a constant amount of time
* instructions: arithmetic (such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, remainder, Ã¼oor, ceiling), data movement (load, store, copy), and control (conditional and unconditional branch, subroutine call and return)
* data types: integer, foating point (for storing real number approximations), and character

The _running time_ is the function of _input size_. We often use the big theta notation to represent the order of growth of the running time.
