key features:
1. fast (without runtime, GC; high level feature compiled to efficient code, known as zero-cost abstraction)
2. reliable

Rust强调fast和safe两方面，不仅仅是对于系统级编程来说。


bad features:
1. symbols shadow within same block (close to the dynamic type???)
2. mutable variable vs. constants


good features:
1. immutable by default
