### 1. Preview

The ultimate goal of robotics is to create machines that can **behave and think like humans**.

The **robot mechanism** is usually constructed by connecting rigid bodies, called **links**, together by means of **joints**, so that relative motion between adjacent links becomes possible. The joints are typically **actuated** by electric motors (AC or DC motors, stepper motors etc.). The ideal motor should operate at relatively low rotational speeds, and be able to generate large forces and torques. So **speed reduction** and **torque amplification** are required. Additionally, the **brakes** may also be attached to stop the robot quickly or to keep a stationary posture.

Sensors are used to measure displacement, velocity, force, torque, and localization.
